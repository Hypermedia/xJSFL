xJSFL To Do's
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Create Debug key-combo from Kohana:

- copies file to file.run.jsfl
- wraps with a try/catch
- if there's an error, outputs it
	- changing the .run filename for the original
	- correcting the line numbers by taking off 1 line (for the try {)
